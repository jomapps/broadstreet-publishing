## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a campaign manager, I want to view a list of my campaigns and select one to see its detailed data, so that I can monitor its performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the main dashboard, **When** I navigate to the campaigns section, **Then** I should see a list of all my campaigns.
2. **Given** I am viewing the list of campaigns, **When** I select a specific campaign, **Then** the application displays the detailed data for that campaign.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Broadstreet API is unavailable?
- What happens when a campaign has no data?
- What happens if the user is not authenticated with the Broadstreet API? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication method is not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a main menu with a sidebar-style dashboard.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST fetch and display a list of campaigns from the Broadstreet API.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select a campaign from the list.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST display detailed data for the selected campaign.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST handle API errors gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the desired graceful error handling behavior? e.g., show a notification, retry button?]
- **FR-006**: The system MUST authenticate with the Broadstreet API. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What authentication method should be used? API key, OAuth? How are credentials stored/managed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Campaign**: Represents an advertising campaign. Key attributes include ID, Name, Status, and other performance metrics.
- **Campaign Data**: Detailed information and statistics for a single campaign.
