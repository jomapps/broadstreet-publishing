# Broadstreet Publishing Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
Every feature begins with a specification. The spec defines the what and why, not the how.

### II. Plan-Driven Implementation
Every spec is followed by a plan. The plan outlines the technical approach and tasks.

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas

### V. Simplicity
Start simple, YAGNI principles. Avoid over-engineering.

### VI. Next.js Best Practices
We adhere to Next.js best practices. Pages should be server-side rendered (SSR) by default. Components can be client-side, but server-side components (RSC) should be used wherever possible to improve performance.
